# First column defines if the command should be issued on sunrise (R) or sunset (S)
# An offset to sunrise/sunset can be defined by setting a minus (-) or a plus (+) sign
# after the R/S specification. If set to + the command will be issued later than the 
# sunrise/sunset as specified by the hour/minutes specification of the cron pattern.
# If set to minus sign (-) the command will be issued earlier by the same specification
# If omitted the command will be issued at sunrise/sunset

# If the first column is set to set to other (-) this column is ignored

# Rest of the columns is defined as the cron command

# Commands are described by either turnon or turnoff followed by the numeric id of the 
# device to turn on or off accordingly.

# in this file you can also define the longitude and latitude of your position to get
# accurate calculations of sunrise and sunset
# This is done by setting the following line. This must be set before any scheduling rows
# COORDS <latitude> <longitude>
